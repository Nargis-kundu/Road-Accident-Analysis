## Road Accident Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify major causes, patterns, and trends. The goal is to help authorities and organizations take preventive measures and improve road safety.

Using **SQL** for data analysis an **Power BI** for visulaization, the project provides insights into accident severity, weather conditions, road surfaces, vechicle involvement and more

# Objectives
- To analyze accident trends across years and locations.
- To identify top contributing factors such as weather, road surface, and light conditions.
- To find accident-prone areas(hotspots).
- To highlight casualties by severity(fatal,serious,slight)
- To assist in decision-making for road safety policies

# Tech Stack
- SQL - Data cleaning & analysis queries
- Power BI - Dashboard & visualizations
- Excel/CSV - Raw Dataset

# Key Insights
- Most accidents occur in single carriageways.
- Rainy weather + wet road surfaces show higher accident counts
- Peak accident time is during evening hours
- Certain locations consistently report higher accident rates.
